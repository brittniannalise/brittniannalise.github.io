recipe:
  servings: 6 Bowls
  prep: 30 minutes
  cook: 2 hours
  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 1 Cup Granulated Sugar
    * 4 Tbs. corn starch
    * 1 Quart Whipping Cream
    * 2 Cups Milk 
    * 1/2 Cup Light Corn Syrup
    * Toppings: Berries, Crumbled Cookies, Chocolate or Strawberry Syrup, etc.

    1. Place sugar and corn starch in medium pot. Mix thoroughly using a whisk.
    2. Mix in remaining ingredients then heat at a medium-high temperature (it burns easily, so be careful), while stirring constantly, until it comes to a boil.
    3. Allow the mixture to boil for about one minute more before removing from heat. 
    4. Transfer the mixture to a bowl (ceramic or metal will facilitate cooling better than plastic) and place in the fridge until it is sufficiently cool to place in your ice cream maker (we are always inpatient and never wait as long as we should, so don't be too worried if it is still a little warm).
    5. Follow the instructions that come with the ice cream maker to freeze the ice cream.
    6. Once it is done, you probably will want to eat it immediately (that's what we do), so put some toppings on and go for it! If you'd like to match the feeling of Cold Stone's ice cream, however, I'd advise to place the ice cream in the freezer for a few hours (perhaps overnight) to allow it to freeze more completely.

First, this is Phillip, Brittni's husband, writing this post. And to start, you should know, i love ice cream. I could eat it every day, and when we have some in the freezer, I do... Since I know I'll cruise through a carton, if I buy ice cream, it will be the cheapest one available in the flavor I am craving.

Brittni, on the other hand, prefers to eat the fancy stuff. If it is a special occasion, or if we are craving ice cream, then she wants Cold Stone! While I like to explore their flavors, since we can't afford to eat there often, her order is as predictable as mine is uncertain. She will undoubtedly get their sweet cream ice cream with berries and possibly cookies and whipped cream mixed in.

At first, I couldn't understand all the hubbub around her order. From my perspective, vanilla was as plain (i.e. boring) as it could get. Sweet cream meant you took the one flavor out of the mix, officially producing the plainest ice cream in history.

I was wrong.

It is delicious!

I don't know why it is so amazing! It is incredibly smooth and the flavor of the cream is more than enough. While the ice cream is scrumptious of its own accord, mix-ins make it unbelievable! Since grad school isn't exactly supporting our ice cream addiction, we have turned to homemade methods and recently stumbled upon a recipe that exactly mimics the flavor and creaminess Cold Stone's! Combine that with the ice cream maker we were gifted for Christmas, and we are working on our third batch already! I hope you enjoy it!
