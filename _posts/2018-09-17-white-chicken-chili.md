The dreaded cold has hit our house this week and it has looked a bit like a game of dominos, with one person falling victim to it every few days. 
Luckily, we have now all suffered our way through it and are just waiting for the last of the four of us to recover!
Accordingly, we have been sticking to a lot of our comfort foods this week (so long as they are quick and easy to make!) and soup was destined to come up!

Classical chili with beans, tomatoes, and beef is not a very common meal in our home, but this creamy alternative is one of our quick and delicious fixes on busy weekdays. 
It comes together pretty quick without a ton of effort and it tastes absolutely great! 
We also had a bit of pizza dough left over from a few days ago, so we rolled those up, basted them with melted butter and generously sprinkled garlic salt overtop to make some soft, warm, and salty breadsticks to dip (or to fling your food across the room as is entertaining for a two-year-old...).

I hope this turns into a family favorite like it has at our house!
