  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 2 lbs. Chicken Breast Tenderloins
    * 1/2 lb. Bacon (ends and pieces works well)

    * 1/3 cup Honey

    * 8 oz. Sliced Mushrooms
    * 1 cup Colby Jack Cheese
  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Preheat Oven to 350 F. 
    2. In a small bowl, combine the mustard, honey and mayonnaise until no lumps are remaining.
    3. In a large skillet at medium-high heat, cook the bacon (~4-5 minutes per side). 
    4. Remove the bacon and place onto paper towels to drain some of the remaining fat.
    5. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Note that chicken breast will work if you do not have tenderloins, you can simply cut it into smaller pieces or pound it thinly so that it cooks more quickly. 
    6. Put the seasoned chicken into the skillet with the remaining bacon fat. Cook for about 5 minutes on one side before flipping the chicken and cooking for another 5 minutes on the other side. 
    7. Remove the chicken from the pan and spread it accross the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish. 
    8. Using a basting brush, spread all of the honey mustard sauce onto the top of the chicken. 
    9. Distribute the mushrooms then the cooked bacon over the top of the chicken. Top with 1 cup of cheese. 
    10. Put the chicken in the preheated oven and cook for 20-25 minutes, until the juices of the chicken run clear and the cheese is bubbling. 
    11. Serve immediately and enjoy!

This is without a doubt a powerhouse of a recipe. "Why?" you ask. Because it has three of the greatest food groups, working together in glorious harmony:
    * Bacon
    * Mushrooms
    * Cheese

If you really think about it, any meal with these three combined can be amazing! As an example, a hamburger is decent, but a bacon cheeseburger with fried mushrooms is irresistable!

Combine those three powerhouses with the tangy sweet basting of honey mustard and our family's main protein, chicken breasts, and we get a weeknight powerhouse meal!

This recipe comes together fairly quickly and easily too, which makes it even better for me! 
You start by cooking up the bacon, then browning the chicken in the rendered bacon fat to provide some extra flavor. 
The chicken is put in the bottom layer of the pan and generously basted with the honey mustard.

All you have to do from here is layer on some mushrooms (you might want more than I show here if you love them like I do!),

top all of that with your bacon,

and finish it off with a healthy heaping of cheese!

If you are looking for an easy side, we added some corn cooked in a small saucepan with salt, pepper, butter and leftover bacon scraps and it paired perfectly!
I hope you enjoy this one as much as we did!
