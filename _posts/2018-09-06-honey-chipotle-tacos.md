    1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees, spray cookie sheet with non-stick spray, set aside.
    2. In a shallow bowl, combine flour and seasonings for the chicken. In another shallow bowl add eggs. In a third shallow bowl combine panko and regular bread crumbs.
    3. Take each chicken strip, dredge in the flour mixture, then shake to remove excess breading. Place in the egg and douse to coat. Then transfer the chicken strips to the bread crumb mixture; evenly coat and press down crumbs so that they adhere.
    4. Place the chicken strips on the prepared baking sheet, and drizzle the melted butter on top. Bake at 450 degrees for 8-10 minutes, then flip and bake for an additional 8-10 minutes, or until the chicken has cooked through and is crispy. Remove from oven.
    5. Cook rice according to the instructions on the packaging. Once finished, combine with cilantro, lime juice, lime zest and a dash of salt and pepper.
    6. While the chicken is baking, prepare your sauce by combining all the sauces ingredients, except the corn starch and water, in a medium saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil while stirring often. While the mixture heats up, whisk the corn starch and water together in a small bowl until the corn starch is dissolved. Add this mixture to the boiling sauce, then continue to whisk while the sauce simmers, waiting approximately 3-4 minutes to allow the sauce to thicken. Set aside completed sauce.
    7. Dip the cooked chicken into the sauce, until fully coated. Set aside until you are ready to assemble your tacos.
    8. Warm the tortillas. Then assemble your tacos by adding rice and chicken strips into the tortilla, drizzling ranch overtop, and finishing with a sprinkle of cilantro. Serve immediately, and enjoy!

This recipe is relatively easy but can be a bit time consuming when you are making them by yourself, because you're breading chicken, baking it, making a sauce from scratch, and making rice.

Because of this, the recipe  has quite a few steps, so we usually save this meal for a weekend when we have more time to cook and aren't racing to get dinner on table like we are during the weekdays.
