I always hated chicken noodle soup growing up, no matter how sick I was! 
When I got married though, my husband's family made this thick, creamy version that I absolutely love.

It is a really quick and easy recipe where most of your time is spent just chopping the vegetables and cooking the noodles.

Also, this recipe usually makes enough for some leftovers, at least at our house, and thankfully, it is able to hold its own when left in the fridge a few days, making it a great candidate for lunches for the next few days!

I hope you enjoy it as much as we do!
