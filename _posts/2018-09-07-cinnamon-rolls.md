    * 1/2 cup granulated sugar
    * 1/3 cup butter
    * 1 tsp salt

    * 4 cups flour
    * 1 cup packed brown sugar
    * 3 tbsp cinnamon
    * 1/3 cup butter

    1. In a small bowl combine the yeast and warm milk, let sit for a couple minutes.
    2. In a large mixing bowl, add sugar, butter, salt, eggs, and flour and mix well.
    3. Add milk/yeast mixture into the mixing bowl, using your dough hook, mix until well incorporated.  
    4. Place your dough in a medium sized bowl sprayed with pam, cover, and let rise for about 1 hour (or until your dough has doubled in size).
    5. Roll your dough out on a lightly floured surface, until it is 16 inches wide and 12 inches long, it should be about 1/4 inch thick.
    6. To make filling, melt 1/3 cup butter and spread over top of your rolled dough evenly.  Combine your cinnamon and brown sugar, and sprinkle over top butter.
    7. Grease a 9x13 inch baking sheet, and preheat oven to 350 degrees.
    8. Working carefully, from the long edge, roll the dough down to the bottom edge.  The roll should be approx. 18 inches long.  Cut the roll into 1 1/2 inch slices.  HINT: you may find it easier to cut the dough with floss as opposed to using a knife.
    9. Place your cut rolls in the prepared pan.  Cover them with a damp towel (this prevents them from drying out), and let them rise for 30 minutes or until double in size.  
    10. Bake for 20 minutes or until light golden brown.  Please note cooking time can vary greatly, so keep an eye on them as they bake!
    11. While the rolls are baking prepare your frosting by beating all ingredients together until fluffy.
    12. When rolls are down, douse them in delicious frosting, and enjoy!!

Things have been crazy at our house lately, we've had back to back colds for what seems to be the last month.  
This last one has been a doozy, and I haven't felt like doing anything lately, let alone cooking.  
But there was a day last week right after one cold ended, and right before the next one started I was scrolling Pinterest and I saw this recipe for copycat Cinnabon cinnamon rolls from Jo Cooks, and I decided to make them right away since they looked so good.  

That was seriously one of my best decisions!  

These things are so delicious, they were soft and gooey - but not doughy - and the cream cheese frosting on the top was to die for!  

Seriously!  

The great thing about these cinnamon rolls is that they save really well in the fridge, up to five days.  
When you're ready to eat one from the fridge, just pop it in the microwave for about 30 seconds and it's a good as new!  

I really hope you enjoy this recipe as much as we did, let me know if you give it a try!
