        Hi there! My name is Brittni Helms and welcome to my blog!
        Whenever a friend asks me for my go to meals, they are always shocked 
        to hear that I seldomly cook the same dinner twice. Our family is 
        about as adventurous as they come with our foods - they say that 
        variety is the spice of life and I like it spicy! 
    </p>
    <p>
        On this blog, I will share my adventures in shaking things up in the
        kitchen and I hope it will spark a flame in yours as well! Every few 
        days I will add a new recipe and the ones I post will run the gamut, 
        from the <b>savory</b> to the <b>sweet</b>, the <b>indulgent</b> to the
        <b>healthy</b>, and from the <b>comfy</b> to the <b>audacious</b>.
        Also, my Instagram stories are usually filled with clips about
        the recipes I am making every day, so follow me so you can ask
        questions and cook along if you'd like!
    </p>

        To tell you a bit about myself,
        I was born in Anchorage, Alaska, and raised in a small town in 
        Utah. When I married my husband, who was practically raised
        in a kitchen, the only cooking story I had involved undercooked
        chicken. After six years, literally moving from coast to coast to coast,
        two kids, and seven years of school, cooking is now my <b>jam</b>! 
        While my husband might want to take the credit for teaching me 
        everything I know, I got it all from the internet, so now is 
        my chance to share what I've learned.
